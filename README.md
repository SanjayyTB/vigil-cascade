# ━━━━ VIGIL SECURE NETWORK ━━━━
## [CLASSIFIED BRIEFING] : IGN-Λ17

> **WARNING**: Omega-7 clearance is required for the following data. Unauthorized access to this protocol will result in immediate neurological termination and session archiving.

### ╼ PROJECT OVERVIEW
**DESIGNATION**: IGN-Λ17 (The Corridor of Choice)  
**STATUS**: [LIVE OPERATIONAL]  
**DIRECT ACCESS**: [igna17.netlify.app](https://igna17.netlify.app/)  
**CLASS**: Cognitive Recursive Anomaly  
**THREAT VECTOR**: Belief Manipulation / Deterministic Feedback Loops  
**ORIGIN**: [REDACTED]

IGN-Λ17 is a self-modifying observational protocol discovered within the VIGIL archives. It manifests as an interactive terminal interface designed to observe decision-making patterns in high-stress cognitive environments.

### ╼ SYSTEM CAPABILITIES
*   **Audio Synthesis**: Procedural heartbeat and low-frequency rumble via native Web Audio components.
*   **Visual Corruption**: CRT-simulated scanlines, flickering text, and "glitch" animations.
*   **Predictive Modeling**: Advanced tracking of hesitation metrics, pattern deviation, and emotional compliance.
*   **Terminal Lockdown**: Automated session isolation upon protocol completion.

### ╼ ACCESS PROTOCOLS (DEVELOPMENT)

To initialize the terminal access in a local environment, follow these standard operation procedures:

1.  **Sync Dependencies**:
    ```sh
    npm i
    ```

2.  **Initialize Terminal**:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Archive System (Build)**:
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

### ╼ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
The VIGIL interface is constructed using high-integrity cognitive modules:
*   **React + TypeScript**: For strict state determinism.
*   **Framer Motion**: For visual fluid-dynamics and corruption effects.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: For granular control over its low-light, high-contrast aesthetic.
*   **Custom Audio Engine**: Built on the native Web Audio API for immersive psychological pressure.
